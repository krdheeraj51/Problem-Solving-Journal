# Coffee Roast Detector
# Given a string representing the beans used to make a cup of coffee, determine the roast of the cup.

# The given string will contain the following characters, each representing a type of bean:

# An apostrophe (') is a light roast bean worth 1 point each.
# A dash (-) is a medium roast bean worth 2 points each.
# A period (.) is a dark roast bean worth 3 points each.
# The roast level is determined by the average of all the beans.

# Return:

# "Light" if the average is less than 1.75.
# "Medium" if the average is 1.75 to 2.5.
# "Dark" if the average is greater than 2.5.

def get_coffee_roast(beans):
    if not beans:
        return "Light"  # Default to Light if no beans are provided

    bean_values = {
        "'": 1,
        "-": 2,
        ".": 3
    }

    total_points = sum(bean_values.get(bean, 0) for bean in beans)
    average = total_points / len(beans)

    if average < 1.75:
        return "Light"
    elif average <= 2.5:
        return "Medium"
    else:
        return "Dark"
    
print(get_coffee_roast("''--.."))  # Output: "Medium"
print(get_coffee_roast("'''"))  # Output: "Light"
print(get_coffee_roast("..."))  # Output: "Dark"
